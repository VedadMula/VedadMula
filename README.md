## Hi there, I'm Vedad 👋

I’m an aspiring technologist building a strong foundation in software engineering with a long-term focus on:

**DevOps Engineering · Cloud Engineering · AI Engineering**

I’m currently developing core skills in **Python**, **Git/GitHub**, and system fundamentals that support all three paths.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code
- Command Line Basics

## 📌 Current Projects
- 🐍 **Hello World (Python)** – a clean starter project to practice structure, documentation, and testing
- 🤖 **AI GitHub Agent** – an AI-powered DevOps automation that analyzes and summarizes GitHub issues using Python and CI/CD pipelines
